I just created a Bash script to automate log rotation ensuring my applications never run out of disk space while keeping backups organized! Here's what it does:
✔ Compresses old logs (.gz)
✔ Clears active logs without losing data
✔ Retains only the latest 10 backups (configurable)
✔ Self-cleaning (removes oldest files automatically)

Prevent log files from growing indefinitely
Save storage space with Gzip compression
Fully automated—zero manual intervention
